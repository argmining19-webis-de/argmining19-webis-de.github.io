He obtained a PhD at the European University Institute (Florence), worked at the Court of Justice of the European Union (Luxembourg), was a researcher at the Italian National Council of Research (ITTIG, Florence), held the chair in Jurisprudence at Queen’s University of Belfast, and was Marie-Curie professor at the European University of Florence. He has been President of the International Association for Artificial Intelligence and Law. He has published widely in legal philosophy, computational logic, legislation technique, and computer law. He is co-director of the Artificial intelligence and law Journal and co-editor of the Ratio Juris Journal. His research interests include legal theory, logic, argumentation theory, modal and deontic logics, logic programming, multiagent systems, computer and Internet law, data protection, e-commerce, law and technology, aviation law, human rights. Among others, he is author of the books "Artificial Intelligence in Law" (Tano, 1993) and "Legal Reasoning: A Cognitive Approach to the Law" (Springer, 2005), as well as co-editor of the "Handbook of Legal Reasoning and Argumentation" (Springer, 2018).

                            Marco Lippi received the B.Sc. Degree (cum laude) and the M.Sc. Degree (cum laude) in Computer Engineering from the University of Florence in 2004 and 2006, respectively. In 2010 he obtained the Ph.D. in Computer and Automation Engineering from the same university. Then, he was Research Assistant at the Universities of Florence (2010-2011), Siena (2011-2014), and Bologna (2014-2016). From March to June 2014 he was visiting scholar at Laboratoire d'Informatique Paris 6 (LIP6) at Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris. Since November 2016, he is an Assistant Professor with tenure track in Computer Engineering at the Department of Sciences and Methods for Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. His research focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence, with applications to natural language processing, argumentation mining, legal informatics, bioinformatics, medicine, and time-series analysis. In 2010 he was awarded the "E. Caianiello" prize for the best Italian PhD thesis in the field of artificial neural networks.
