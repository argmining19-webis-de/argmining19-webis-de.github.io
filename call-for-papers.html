                <ul >
                    <li>Automatic identification of argument components (premises and conclusions or more fine-grained), and relations between arguments and counterarguments (support and attack or more fine-grained) in as well as across documents;
                    </li>
                    <li>Automatic assessment of properties of arguments and argumentation, such as argumentation schemes, stance, quality, and persuasiveness;
                    </li>
                    <li>Automatic synthesis of arguments and their components, including the con- sideration of discourse goals (e.g., stages of a critical discussion or rhetorical strategies) and the possibly needed preceding analyses;
                    </li>
                    <li>Creation and evaluation of argument annotation schemes, relationships to linguistic and discourse annotations, (semi-) automatic argument annotation methods and tools, and creation of argumentation corpora;
                    </li>
                    <li>Management of spoken and transcribed dialogue, argument mining from such data, including additional challenges posed by real-time processing;
                    </li>
                    <li>Combination of NLP methods and AI models developed for argumentation, such as abstract and structured argumentation frameworks;
                    </li>
                    <li>Combination of information retrieval methods with argument mining, e.g. in order to build the next generation of argumentative (web) search engines;
                    </li>
                    <li>Use of argument mining for studying research questions from the social sciences, digital humanities, and related fields;
                    </li>
                    <li>Real-world applications, including argument web search, opinion analysis in customer reviews, argument analysis in meetings, and applications in specific domains such as education, law, and scientific writing.
                    </li>

        <p> The workshop is running a double-blind review process. In preparing your manuscript, do not include any information which could reveal your identity, or that of your co-authors. The title section of your manuscript should not contain any author names, email addresses, or affiliation status. If you do include any author names on the title page, your submission will be automatically rejected. In the body of your submission, you should eliminate all direct references to your own previous work. That is, avoid phrases such as "this contribution generalizes our results for XYZ". Also, please do not disproportionately cite your own previous work. In other words, make your submission as anonymous as possible. We need your cooperation in our effort to maintain a fair, double-blind reviewing process - and to consider all submissions equally. 
        </p>

        <p>ArgMining 2019 will adhere to the <a target="_blank" href="http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation">policies and guidelines for submission, review and citation</a>, recently released by the ACL. Submissions that violate any of these policies will be rejected without review.
        </p>
        <p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues should indicate this at submission time. 
            Upon acceptance at either event, the submission must be withdrawn from the other. 
            To save reviewers efforts, avoid submitting (or withdraw early) papers that are on track to be accepted elsewhere.</p>
