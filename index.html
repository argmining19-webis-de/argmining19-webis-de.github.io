        <h1>About the workshop</h1>
        <p>Argument mining (also, “argumentation mining”) is a relatively new research field within the rapidly evolving area of Computational Argumentation. The tasks pursued within this field are highly challenging with many important practical applications. These include automatically identifying argumentative structures within discourse, e.g., premises, conclusion, and argumentation scheme of each argument, as well as relationships between pairs of arguments and their components. </p>
