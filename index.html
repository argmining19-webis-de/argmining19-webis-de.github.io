        <p>Argument mining (also, “argumentation mining”) is a relatively new research field within the rapidly evolving area of Computational Argumentation. The tasks pursued within this field are highly challenging with many important practical applications. These include automatically identifying argumentative structures within discourse, e.g., premises, conclusion, and argumentation scheme of each argument, as well as relationships between pairs of arguments and their components. To date, researchers have investigated a plethora of methods to address these tasks in various areas, including legal documents, user generated Web discourse, on-line debates, product reviews, academic literature, newspaper articles, dialogical domains, and Wikipedia articles. Relevant manually annotated corpora are released at an increasing pace, further enhancing the research in the field. In addition, argument mining is inherently tied to sentiment analysis, since an argument frequently carries a clear sentiment towards its topic. Correspondingly, this year’s workshop will be coordinated with the corresponding WASSA workshop, aiming to have a joint poster session.

        <p>Argument mining can give rise to various applications of great practical importance. For instance, by developing methods that can extract and visualize the main pro and con arguments raised in a collection of documents towards a query of interest, one can enhance data-driven decision making. In instructional contexts, argumentation is a pedagogically important tool for conveying and assessing the students' command of course material, as well as for advancing critical thinking. Written and diagrammed arguments by students represent educational data that can be mined for purposes of assessment and instruction. This is especially important given the wide-spread adoption of computer-supported peer review, computerized essay grading, and large-scale online courses and MOOCs. Additionally, mining pros and cons may be useful in multiple business applications, for instance, for researching a company or considering the potential of a possible investment.
        </p>
        <p>Success in argument mining requires interdisciplinary approaches informed by natural language processing technology, artificial intelligence approaches, theories of semantics, pragmatics and discourse, knowledge of discourse of domains such as law and science, argumentation theory, computational models of argumentation, and cognitive psychology. The goal of this workshop is to provide a follow-on forum to the last four years’ Argument Mining workshops at ACL and EMNLP, the major research forum devoted to argument mining in all domains of discourse.
