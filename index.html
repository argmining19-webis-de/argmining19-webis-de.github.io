                <h1>About the workshop</h1>
                <p>Argument mining (also known as "argumentation mining") is a young and emerging research area within
                        computational linguistics. At its heart, argument mining involves the automatic identification
                        of argumentative structures in free text, such as the conclusions, premises, and inference
                        schemes of arguments as well as their interrelations and counter-considerations.</p>
                <p>To date, researchers have investigated argument mining on genres such as legal documents, product
                        reviews, news articles, online debates, user-generated web discourse, Wikipedia articles,
                        academic literature, persuasive essays, tweets, and dialogues. Recently, also argument quality
                        assessment came into focus. In addition, argument mining is inherently tied to stance and
                        sentiment analysis, since every argument carries a stance towards its topic, often expressed
                        with sentiment.</p>
                <p>Argument mining gives rise to various practical applications of great importance. In particular, it
                        provides methods that can find and visualize the main pro and con arguments in a text corpus -
                        or even on in an argument search on the web - towards a topic or query of interest. In
                        instructional contexts, written and diagrammed arguments represent educational data that can be
                        mined for conveying and assessing students' command of course material. In information
                        retrieval, argument mining is expected to play a salient role in the emerging field of
                        conversational search. And with the IBM Debater, technology based on argument mining recently
                        received a lot of media attention.</p>
                <p>While solutions to basic tasks such as component segmentation and classification slowly become
                        mature, many tasks remain largely unsolved, particularly in more open genres and topical
                        domains. Success in argument mining requires interdisciplinary approaches informed by NLP
                        technology, theories of semantics, pragmatics and discourse, knowledge of discourse in
                        application domains, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, argumentation theory, and
                        computational models of argumentation. </p>
